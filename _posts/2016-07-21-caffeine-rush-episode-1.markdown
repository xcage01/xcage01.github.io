We all love that cup of coffee in morning. It gives a rush that makes us super productive. I have frequently used that to get work done. Recently i quit my job at MNC and started my new job as an entrepreneur. Things are obvious with long working hours and a lot of work still to be done. Recently i came across [7daystartup](http://7daystartup.com/) which seems to be a validated idea by [Dan](https://www.facebook.com/dannorrisinformly) who also has a very rad story to back up the concept. Now i always believe in experimentation rather than following blindly so this morning i decided to give it a shot. What i will be doing is keep my current project on hold and make a simple application that i can put in the market in 7 days. The idea that i have in mind is a lot similar to survey monkey with focus on machine learning and entrepreneurs. Its mid-afternoon here and i am about to get my cup of coffee to get started. I will try and document all the progress that i made in that time here in this blog to keep it more intuitive.

# Making a time-line of project

I always believe in planning twice and doing stuff once. Well it usually applies to software development but why not over here also. It's 1:30 noon here and i think i will give it an hour including the time it takes me to go make coffee and work on a game plan.

Its 2:00 and i have already come up with game plan and coffee. Going to save some time and start working on it now. if all goes fine, i should be able to complete the beta software in 4 hours which is pretty doable considering i will be in my `zone` 

# Server setup

I always prefer to setup my own git on server, makes deployment simpler. This is pretty much my first task to configure server to host jekyll and django application using git push. Obviously i will also have to create a new database user which i am not very good at but security does matter.

Jekyll was the simpler and took me a couple of minutes, django is gonna take some time because of its complicated nature.

Finally had the server setup done with nginx running the ui and api both of the properly and upstart managing the django application. Its `2:30` now which was technically the time i had to finish on planning. I am moving 30 minuted before schedule which i think is pretty cool. Moving on to next task which is basic UI setup. This one is going to take some time because of the fact that i am predominantly i backend programmer.

FYI need a system restart as my KDE just crashed. Going to save this as draft and will be back in 10 minutes moving with other tasks on list.
